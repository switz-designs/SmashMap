## SmashMap

SmashMap is a fighting game tournament management app which eschews the traditional ladder format for a 4X-style area control meta-game. Battles for control of an area are decided by a breakout game of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate; or, with a few tweaks, any other fighting game you wish.

See the wiki for screenshots of the app in action!
